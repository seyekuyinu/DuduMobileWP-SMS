FAQs
----
Are the text messages free?
As at time of release for this plugin, DuduSMS is not free. You will have to purchase SMS from Dudumobile's corporate SMS page. You never know, they may offer it free of charge.

Do you or your organization own Dudumobile/DuduSMS
No, we don't. We just happen to use the SMS Gateway very often for clients so I thought to plug it into WordPress for 'plug and play' installation.

What if I have issues sending SMS?
DuduSMS is not owned by me or the company I work with. For support, go to http://dudumobile.com for support

My SMS credit is exhausted, how do I buy more
